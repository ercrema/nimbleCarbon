The _nimbleCarbon_ package provides utility functions and bespoke probability distributions for the Bayesian analyses of radiocarbon dates using the [NIMBLE](https://r-nimble.org/) framework. The package is particularly dedicated to demographic inferences based on changing frequencies of radiocarbon dates and enables parameter estimations and model comparison for the following population growth models:

* Exponential
* Logistic
* Double-Exponential
* Exponential-Logistic

Community contributions of additional growth models and features are welcome.
